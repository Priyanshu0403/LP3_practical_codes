    "# ...💬 Relevant Viva Questions and AnswersCore KNN Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How does the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm make a prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: KNN is a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm that is instance-based. To classify a new data point, it finds the K nearest neighbors (data points) in the feature space based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance). The new point is then assigned the class that is most common (majority vote) among those $K$ neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What is the main weakness of the KNN algorithm, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data or large datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: KNN is computationally expensive during the prediction phase, as it requires calculating the distance between the new data point and every single point in the training set. This is particularly slow for large datasets. Additionally, its performance degrades in high-dimensional spaces (the \"curse of dimensionality\"), as distance metrics become less meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Did this code apply feature scaling (like StandardScaler)? Should it have, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: No, the provided code did not apply feature scaling. Yes, it absolutely should have. KNN is heavily influenced by the magnitude of the features because it relies on distance calculations. Features with larger numerical ranges (like Insulin or EstimatedSalary) will disproportionately dominate the distance calculation, regardless of their actual importance. Scaling features to a consistent range is critical for KNN performance.Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Based on the confusion matrix, which value represents a severe clinical error in this diabetes prediction model?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The False Negative (FN) value, which is 23. A False Negative means the model predicted a patient was Non-Diabetic (0) when they were actually Diabetic (1). In a medical context, missing a positive diagnosis can lead to delayed treatment and severe consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Explain the difference between Precision and Recall for this model, and why both are important\n",
    "\n",
    ".A:Precision (0.525): Out of all patients the model predicted were diabetic, only 52.5% actually were. Low precision means a high rate of False Positives (wasted follow-up tests or unnecessary worry).Recall (0.582): Out of all patients who actually have diabetes (TP + FN), the model correctly identified 58.2% of them. Recall measures the model's ability to find all the positive cases. Since minimizing False Negatives (missing a diagnosis) is medically critical, a high recall is often prioritized for screening tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How is the Error Rate related to Accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The Error Rate is simply the complement of Accuracy.$$\\text{Error Rate} = 1 - \\text{Accuracy}$$It represents the proportion of total predictions that were incorrect ($(\\text{FP} + \\text{FN}) / \\text{Total}$)."
